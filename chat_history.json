QR Scanner Screen (`app/qr-scanner.tsx`)**\n- Full camera integration using `expo-camera`\n- Visual scanning frame with corner indicators\n- Permission handling with user-friendly UI\n- Validates QR codes to ensure they contain valid IP:Port addresses\n- Supports both formats: `192.168.1.100:8080` or `http://192.168.1.100:8080`\n- \"Scan Again\" functionality\n\n**3. WebView Screen (`app/webview.tsx`)**\n- Displays the audio stream webpage in a WebView\n- Loading indicator while connecting\n- Error handling with retry functionality\n- Reload button in the header\n- Supports audio playback with proper media settings\n- User-friendly error messages\n\n**4. Updated Color Scheme (`styles/commonStyles.ts`)**\n- Background: `#f0f0f0` (Light gray)\n- Text: `#333333` (Dark gray)\n- Primary: `#007AFF` (iOS blue)\n- Secondary: `#5AC8FA` (Light blue)\n- Accent: `#FF9500` (Orange)\n- Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n\n**5. Permissions (`app.json`)**\n- Camera permissions configured for both iOS and Android\n- Proper permission descriptions for App Store compliance\n\n### How It Works:\n\n1. **Manual Entry**: Users enter the IP address and port, then tap \"Connect\" to open the stream in a WebView\n2. **QR Code**: Users tap \"Scan QR Code\", grant camera permission, and scan a QR code containing the stream address\n3. **Stream Access**: The WebView loads the webpage where users can interact with the \"join\" button to access the audio stream\n\n### Key Features:\n- \u2705 Clean, modern UI with smooth animations\n- \u2705 Support for both light and dark modes\n- \u2705 Keyboard-aware input handling\n- \u2705 Comprehensive error handling\n- \u2705 Loading states and user feedback\n- \u2705 Camera permission management\n- \u2705 WebView with audio playback support\n- \u2705 Reload and retry functionality\n\nThe app is ready to use!

I've removed the blue circle from the home screen. The changes I made:\n\n- Removed the `iconContainer` View that contained the blue circle\n- Removed the `iconCircle` View with the waveform icon\n- Removed the associated styles (`iconContainer` and `iconCircle`)\n\nNow your home screen will display just the title \"Join Audio Stream\" at the top, followed by the subtitle and the rest of the content, without the blue circle icon. The UI will be cleaner and more streamlined!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-06T19:40:03Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "can you please also add another menu in which the user can save recently visited audio streams and name them "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I can help you with that.
